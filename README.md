In this project, me (Andrea Edson Lorenzoni) and (Pedro Ferreira) we worked together to complete the assignment. The project include: 
- appendix B (JDBC Application for ITunes).

Customer requirements for appendix B:
For customers in the database, the following functionality should be catered for:
   1. Read all the customers in the database, this should display their: Id, first name, last name, country, postal code,
      phone number and email.
   2. Read a specific customer from the database (by Id), should display everything listed in the above point.
   3. Read a specific customer by name. HINT: LIKE keyword can help for partial matches.
   4. Return a page of customers from the database. This should take in limit and offset as parameters and make use
      of the SQL limit and offset keywords to get a subset of the customer data. The customer model from above
      should be reused.
   5. Add a new customer to the database. You also need to add only the fields listed above (our customer object)
   6. Update an existing customer.
   7. Return the country with the most customers.
   8. Customer who is the highest spender (total in invoice table is the largest)
   9. For a given customer, their most popular genre (in the case of a tie, display both). Most popular in this context
      means the genre that corresponds to the most tracks from invoices associated to that customer.
